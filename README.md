# task2-gci

This is the submission to the task *Set up a Google Cloud Function that returns "Hello World" to the browser*, by [SugarLabs](https://sugarlabs.org/) for the [Google Code-in.](https://codein.withgoogle.com/)

I created this directory where I made the Cloud Funtcion through the Firebase CLI.
In the functions folder, the *index.js* script is the script which returns "Hello World!".
