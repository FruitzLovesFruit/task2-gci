# task2-gci

This is the submission to the task "Set up a Google Cloud Function that returns "Hello World" to the browser", by SugarLabbs for the Google Code-in.

I created this directory where I made the Cloud Funtcion through the Firebase CLI.
In the functions folder, the index.js script is the script which returns "Hello World!".

For the link, you can:
Download this file
Then cd into the main folder "SugarLabs-GCI-task2"
Then cd into the "functions" folder.
Then you can use "firebase deploy" command to see the function.
